condition of individual trees in greater detail than is possible using remotely sensed imagery.',\n 'Although the house call a decade ago was declared a vanishing practice, statistics show an upwelling of home visits by physicians, in the developed countries, during the last ten years.',\n 'A major reason for this is the radical alteration of the contents of the physiciansu0027 black bag that beyond the stethoscope includes also, a Personal Digital Assistant with embedded Cell- phone safekeeping detailed patient-records, sophisticated point-of-care diagnostic equipment and reagents, along with other technical means, that allow for providing care, comparable to that of an emergency room, at home.',\n 'It is the purpose of the present study to to present the technical and

of mobile computers improves health care delivery by allowing the medical staff to access important patient information during visits to the patient bedside or in emergency situations.',\n 'This paper presents a software technology in which the medical and nursing staff will be equipped with handheld computers connected via radio to a central server that provides access to the patientsu0027 data and actively informs about pending task distributions.',\n 'The server works as a database for DICOM compliant information, ranging from patientu0027s computerized tomography (CT), ultrasonography

recovery of these DICOM archives possible through a local wireless network and a personal digital assistant (PDA)-compatible graphical user interface (GUI).',\n 'Personal digital assistants are designed to assist users in easy information retrieval or execute the tasks they are interested in.',\n 'The conversational medium implies an additional level of intelligence but typically these systems do not support any reference to the useru0027s past interactions.',\n 'We propose a domain-agnostic approach that enables the system to address queries referring to the past by using an information retrieval approach to rank various entities for a given query.',\n 'We also add semantic enrichment to the recall process by augmenting the entities with information from a knowledge graph and leverage that in the retrieval process.',\n 'We mined user interactions for the Cortana digital assistant to extract queries with location and business entities and show that our technique can achieve an accuracy of 89.8% for such recall queries.',\n 'Conversational agents such as Alexa and Google Assistant constantly need to increase their language understanding capabilities by adding new domains.',\n 'A massive amount of labeled data is required for training each new domain.',\n 'While domain adaptation approaches alleviate the annotation cost, prior approaches suffer from increased training time and suboptimal concept alignments.',\n 'To tackle this, we introduce a novel Zero-Shot Adaptive Transfer method for slot tagging that utilizes the slot description for transferring reusable concepts across domains, and enjoys efficient training without any explicit concept alignments.',\n 'Extensive experimentation over a dataset of 10 domains relevant to our commercial personal

system.',\n 'Users can collect data for the KJ method using GMemo easily with no omission, and input ideas in free handwriting.',\n 'We applied the data stored in GMemo to GUNGEN.',\n 'The result of the application of GMemo shows that (1) most ideas were generated by users and collected from noon to evening at University or home, (2) when handwritten characters were used as ideas for GUNGEN, the reduced handwritten characters seemed to be legible, (3) The drawing area in GMemo is so small that we should equip GMemo with a scroll function.',\n 'This paper presents a Bluetooth based

people who are on the go to be more entertained, informed, and con nected, the small-form factor of mobile devices makes manag ing all of this content a difficult task.',\n 'This difficulty is significantly amplified when we consider how many people are using these devices while driving in automobiles and the high risk of driver distraction such devices present.',\n 'A recent govern ment study concluded that drivers performing complex secondary tasks such as operating or viewing a mobile device or personal digital assistant (PDA) were between 1.7 and 5.5 times more likely to be

devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistant (PDA).',\n 'In contrast to many existing interaction methods that attempt to address the same problem, ours offers direct manipulation of the pointer position with continuous visual feedback.',\n 'The primary advantage of this technique is that it only requires equipment that is readily available: an electronic display, a handheld digital camera, and a connection between the two.',\n 'No special visual markers in the display content are needed, nor are fixed cameras pointing at the display.',\n 'We evaluated the performance of Direct Pointer as an interaction product, showing that it performs as well as comparable techniques that require more sophisticated equipment.',\n 'Nursing students can learn many things through practical training by experiencing actual medical practice and by coming in contact with patients.',\n 'Therefore practical training is an effective learning opportunity for developing the practical nursing care ability of nursing students.',\n 'Moreover, at hospitals, which are important training facilities, with regard to medical safety, the use of learning tools that produce electrical waves is not possible.',\n 'So, we created a learning support environment that facilitates the imagination of nursing techniques, and enables effective preparation, review, and learning at anytime and
